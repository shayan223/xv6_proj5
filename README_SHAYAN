This project is my implementation of multiple features to the xv6 operating system

Please view other README's for credits and copy write information

This repository holds 5 different projects/modifications. You may compile and run any of them by changing the 
project variable in the makefile to the desired project number.

The projects implement different features as follows:

1. date system call and process list display
2. Process structures and "ps" command
3. More efficient process management (process life cycle with complex concurrency control rather than a simple process list) 
4. MLFQ (Multi Level Feedback Queue) for process management
5. file permissions
